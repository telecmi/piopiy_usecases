## **Streaming API Use Cases**

### **1. Real-time Conversation AI Integration**

- **Scenario:** A customer calls a service number, and the call is immediately streamed via WebSocket to an AI system. The AI processes the conversation in real-time, interacting with the customer through predefined responses. If the AI cannot handle the conversation, the call is transferred to a human agent.
- **Applications:** Customer support, virtual assistants, automated help desks.

### **2. Live ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) Processing**

- **Scenario:** During a live call, the audio is streamed to an ASR system for real-time transcription. The ASR system converts speech to text, which is then used by an AI to provide responses or further action. If the AI identifies that the call requires human intervention, it can trigger a call transfer.
- **Applications:** Live transcription services, voice-activated assistants, customer feedback analysis.

### **3. Automated Information Retrieval**

- **Scenario:** A customer calls in to retrieve specific information (e.g., account balance, delivery status). The call is streamed to a conversation AI, which processes the request and responds with the relevant information. The AI can also take further actions based on the conversation, such as transferring the call to another department if needed.
- **Applications:** Banking services, order status inquiries, automated customer service.

### **4. AI-based Call Routing**

- **Scenario:** Calls are streamed to an AI that analyzes the conversation in real-time to determine the best course of action. Based on the customer’s needs, the AI can route the call to the appropriate department or escalate it to a human agent if necessary.
- **Applications:** Intelligent call routing, dynamic customer support, issue resolution services.

### **5. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Enhancement**

- **Scenario:** An IVR system is enhanced with real-time AI processing. Calls are streamed to an AI that interacts with the caller based on the input received. If the AI cannot provide the necessary assistance, the call is transferred to a live agent or an appropriate service department.
- **Applications:** Advanced IVR systems, self-service portals, automated customer interaction.

### **6. Language Translation and Interpretation**

- **Scenario:** Calls are streamed to a real-time translation system via WebSocket. The AI translates the conversation as it happens and provides responses in the desired language. If the AI struggles to manage the translation or interpretation, the call can be transferred to a human interpreter.
- **Applications:** Multilingual customer support, international communication, live translation services.

### **7. Sentiment Analysis and Escalation**

- **Scenario:** During a call, the conversation is streamed to an AI that performs sentiment analysis in real-time. If the AI detects negative sentiment or customer frustration, it can trigger an immediate call transfer to a senior agent or manager for resolution.
- **Applications:** Customer satisfaction monitoring, escalated support, real-time issue management.

## **Conclusion**

PIOPIY’s Streaming API enables seamless integration with AI systems for real-time conversation processing. By streaming live calls via WebSocket, developers can build sophisticated AI-driven interactions, with the flexibility to transfer calls to human agents when necessary.
