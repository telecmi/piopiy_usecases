## **Custom Contact Center Use Cases**

### **1. Personalized Call Routing**

- **Scenario:** A customer calls into the contact center, and the system checks the customer’s history, such as previous interactions or open tickets. Based on this information, the call is routed to the most appropriate team or agent who can best address the customer’s needs.
- **Applications:** Technical support centers, customer service departments, priority support for premium users.

### **2. Ticketing System Integration**

- **Scenario:** When a call is received, the system automatically pulls up the customer’s ticket history from an integrated ticketing system. The agent handling the call is provided with the customer’s past interactions, enabling them to offer more informed and efficient support.
- **Applications:** IT helpdesks, product support teams, service-based businesses.

### **3. Custom Call Recording**

- **Scenario:** Every call in the contact center can be recorded based on custom logic defined by the developer. For instance, calls related to specific issues or escalations can be flagged for recording, ensuring that important interactions are documented for future reference.
- **Applications:** Quality assurance, compliance monitoring, training and development.

### **4. Intelligent Call Handling**

- **Scenario:** Calls are handled dynamically based on custom rules set by the developer. For example, if the customer’s query is related to a billing issue, the system can automatically provide information or route the call to the billing department, based on predefined criteria.
- **Applications:** Automated customer service, intelligent call distribution, self-service portals.

### **5. Multi-Channel Interaction**

- **Scenario:** The contact center can handle multiple communication channels (voice, SMS, email) through the same platform. A customer’s history across all channels is consolidated, allowing agents to view a complete interaction history and respond more effectively.
- **Applications:** Omni-channel support centers, integrated customer communication platforms, unified service desks.

## **Conclusion**

PIOPIY’s API-based platform enables developers to build highly customizable contact centers that cater to specific business needs. From personalized call routing to real-time analytics, PIOPIY provides the flexibility to create a contact center solution that evolves with your business.
